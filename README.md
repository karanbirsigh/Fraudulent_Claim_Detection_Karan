# Fraudulent_Claim_Detection_Karan

Overview
Financial fraud is often associated with sophisticated urban areas. However, in the context of insurance fraud, rural regions in India have shown higher involvement due to various socio-economic factors. Despite efforts such as the development of fraudster databases, these malpractices are difficult to control without strict legal repercussions.
Insurance companies have flagged over 80 districts across India that have shown a consistent pattern of fraudulent claims. These fraud networks function with the discipline and efficiency of a corporate entity, using data collection techniques that rival those of modern startups.
One contributing factor is the lack of due diligence during policy underwriting by insurers. This has enabled criminal networks to operate effectively, even targeting terminally ill individuals to exploit insurance policies.

Objective
Traditional fraud detection typically relies on heuristics or rules-based systems.
* In some cases, predefined rules determine whether a claim should be investigated.
* Alternatively, a scoring checklist based on indicators of fraud and the claim value helps in deciding investigation priorities.
This project aims to apply Machine Learning (ML) techniques to automate and enhance the fraud detection process.

Dataset
The dataset includes various attributes of insurance claims, including personal details, claim amount, incident types, and other indicators that may help in identifying fraudulent claims.

Libraries Used
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* plotly
* cufflinks

Algorithms Implemented
* Decision Tree
* k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
* k-Means Clustering
* Random Forest Classifier
These models help in classifying whether a claim is fraudulent based on historical patterns and indicators.

Results
The implemented machine learning models provide varying degrees of accuracy, precision, and recall in detecting fraud. Random Forest Classifier performed best among the models tested, with a high detection rate and lower false positives.


Conclusion
Machine Learning significantly improves fraud detection by automating the identification process, potentially saving millions of dollars for insurance companies.
